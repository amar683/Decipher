1. If uploads folder is completely empty while deploying. it shows Internal Server Error
2. If user have '?' in article title string. then it will give 404 error. because it acts as a query string so it doesnt count it.... thats why for the time being i am passing article id in req.params
3.sometimes while defining dynamic routes in get and post method if two routes are like this
        app.post("/articles/:articleId/:userId,())
        app.post("/articles/delete/:articleId,())
        in this case it will always execute that post route which you have defined first and second will never get executed
        because first route will think that variable articleId=delete of second route
